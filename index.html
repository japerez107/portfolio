        <p>
          My name is Jacqueline but you can call me Jaque for short. I graduated from the University of Hartford
          in Conneticut, with a Bacherlors in Computer Engineering Technology. I currently working at a hotel as a
          Guest Service Rep.
        </p>

        <p>I’m a Full Stack Developer who specializes in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I have always had an interest in
          the Technology and the ever growing field. I first got interest in Web Development in College when I was
          working on my Senior Capstone; we created a website for our project that included basic HTML and some
          JavaScript. It was then that I really started to look into what web development was and how to go about
          starting my journey into the field. I love that I can be creative on the front-end side and use logic on the
          back-end to see everything come together.
